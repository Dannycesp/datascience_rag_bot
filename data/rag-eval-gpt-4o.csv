"Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, Grid Search exhaustively explores parameter combinations, Random Search randomly samples from a predefined space, and Bayesian Optimization uses Bayesian inference to direct the search efficiently.",125,List different methods to find optimal hyperparameters for a model.,RELEVANT,"The generated answer lists different methods for finding optimal hyperparameters, specifically mentioning Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization, along with brief descriptions of each method, which directly addresses the question asked."
"Each category is represented by a binary vector where only one bit is ""hot"" (set to 1) for each category, indicating its presence.",173,How are categories represented in one-hot encoding?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes how categories are represented in one-hot encoding, specifically mentioning the binary vector and the concept of one bit being 'hot' for each category, which directly addresses the question."
